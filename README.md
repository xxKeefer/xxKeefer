### 🧔 A little about me

I love tech. They say any sufficiently advanced tech is like magic to the uninitiated, and who doesn't want to be a Wizard? I love to use React and Typescript to turn problems into magic on the internet. Outside of tech, I am married to my highschool sweetheart and love my two wonderful daughters. I love to cook as a bit of a zen activity to avoid burnout, my pickled onions are to die for. What's left of my free time gets spent telling stories with friends through role playing games. Currently I enjoy helping one of my best friends to develop a rules system for telling stories called Omen.
